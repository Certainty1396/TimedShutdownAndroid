    <string name="info_text_1">This app uses the accessibility permission to simulate the manual gestures used to power off the phone. \n<b>The accessibility permission is required</b> in order to be able to call the power dialog and then simulate the gestures to turn off the phone.

    <string name="power_button_desc">This button will call the power dialog so that it is possible to check which action should be performed. <b>This button will not power off the phone</b>, it will just call the power dialog. To power off the phone use the timer in the Timer tab.</string>
    <string name="draggables_desc">These draggable elements can be repositioned around the screen to reproduce the gestures (click(s)/swipe) used to power off the phone</string>
    <string name="info_text_settings_1">On the <b>Settings tab</b> it is possible to <b>select the type of gestures required to turn off the phone</b>. After selecting the type of gesture (one click, two clicks or a swipe) the user has to drag the draggable circles where the click(s) should be simulated. Click the button to watch a short video about how it works.</string>
    <string name="info_text_settings_2">In case two clicks are selected the app will simulate first the click of circle one and then the click of circle two, with a delay of 3 seconds between. In case the swipe is selected, the app will simulate a swipe from point one to point two.</string>
    <string name="info_text_timer">On the <b>Timer tab</b> it is possible to <b>set up a timer to power off the phone</b>. It is first necessary to give the accessibility permission and to set up the settings tab for the app to be able to emulate the power off gesture.\n<b>The timer is in seconds</b> and the spinner on the right will select how many seconds, the spinner on the center how many minutes, the spinner on the left how many hours the timer will wait before powering off the phone. It is also possible to select the specific time for the phone shutdown using the button <b>Select Time</b>.\n<b>This app should <i>theoretically</i> work even if the screen is off</b>, but that may vary based on the battery optimization, power saving mode, phone model and so on. It is suggested to leave the phone (even locked) on the timer tab after starting the countdown. The power off gestures could require extra time after the set timer if the time while the screen is totally off is more than 5 minutes.</string>
